Intelly is a platform being built to help small-to-medium food and beverage brands manage various aspects of their business. The project is divided into separate repos as services are developed on different timelines. Currently the retail data dashboard (this repo) and the Node.js/Express server (link below) are the two with public demos.

The public demo of the retail data service is deployed on Netlify (https://happy-saha-7828d3.netlify.app/), and is updated with each significant addition to the private version. It can be accessed with the following credentials:

email: admin@intelly.test

This project has been built with React, CSS, Material-UI, ChartsJS, and Emailjs. It accesses a server that is hosted separately on Heroku. The repo for that project is located at https://github.com/tomekregulski/intelly-server.

The private version of this project is currently in its first trial stage with clients. Upon its completion, a second trial with a larger group of clients is planned, after which it will be officially launched.
